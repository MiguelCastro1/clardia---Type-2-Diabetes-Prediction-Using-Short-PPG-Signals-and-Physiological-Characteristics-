# Introduction
The Project focuses on developing a classifier to predict type 2 diabetes using short recorded PPG signals and physiological characteristics.

The Original Dataset: 
Liang,Yongbo,etal."Anew,short-recordedphotoplethysmogramdatasetforbloodpres- sure monitoring in China." Scientific data 5 (2018): 180020.

The main features identified in literature related to the PPG signal have been extracted using the Matlab software. The extracted features are used as the input to the models.
